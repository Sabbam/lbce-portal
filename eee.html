        <p class="fw-400" data-aos="zoom-in">Electrical and Electronics Engineering is the oldest branch in the field of engineering. It is the largest and fastest growing branch field which deals with the academic study and practical applications of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. The department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) is made functional with an aim to produce qualified engineers with sound knowledge in electrical engineering and a strong background in electronics. The course is designed in such a way that students can be able to apply their knowledge, skills and the most recent technological developments to fulfil the domestic as well as industrial needs in our society.</p>
<br/>
        <P class="fw-400" data-aos="zoom-in">Trained electrical engineers can be able to design electric circuits and equipment. Besides, they can work on large power plants as well as in small hardware companies which includes designing, manufacturing and operating power plants, industrial machinery, electrical motors, computer chips and ignition systems for automobiles, aircrafts, space crafts and all kinds of engines. They play significant role in planning, designing, implementing and evaluating product, services and systems for fulfilling the socio-economic needs of the people.
