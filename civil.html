        <p class="fw-400" data-aos="zoom-in-up">Engineering has been an aspect of life. A civil engineer is responsible for all aspects of building structures – comprising the planning, design, budgeting, construction management, surveying and analysis. It is the branch with a lot of diversity right from Surveying, Geo-technology to Structural Engineering, Environmental Sciences to Hydraulics, and Transportation to Hydrology. Civil Engineering can be considered as the single largest core engineering branch.
