        <p class="fw-400" data-aos="zoom-in">The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering was established simultaneously with the genesis of the Dr. Lankapalli Bulllaya College of Engineering in 2010 with an annual intake of 60 students. The department offers an under-graduate course of four-year duration in Electronics & Communication Engineering. The proficient faculty members in the department impart High Quality Technical education to inquisitive students of technical education. Each faculty member is actively involved in research work in his/her respective fields of specialization.

        </p>
<br/>
        <P class="fw-400" data-aos="zoom-in">The laboratories are well equipped with modern facilities that cater to the requirements of the university syllabus. They are useful for conducting experiments in Basic & Advanced Electronics. The department encourages the budding engineers to undertake several Projects and gain practical knowledge. The goal of the department is to inculcate students with strong foundation in Analytical and Technical Skills. An incubation centre has been setup with four wings (Electronics, Antennas, Signal Processing and Communication Systems) to encourage the students and develop their creative abilities in the field. And it also motivates them to undertake Mini Projects for making them employable to become prolific technocrats in industry.


        </P><br/>
<p data-aos="zoom-in">The department has active interaction with reputed Technical Education institutes. It also endeavors to create Promising Electronic and Communication Engineers who can fulfill the perennial needs of our modern society and become instrumental in strengthening the economy of our nation. The faculty members are actively involved in research in the areas such as Mobile Communications, Digital Communications, Antennas, Phased Array Radars, Signal processing & high frequency communications, Fiber optic Communications, Instrumentation, VLSI and Microprocessors. </p><br/>
<p data-aos="zoom-in">In order to improve and update their technical knowledge, the students are encouraged to associate themselves with other Professional Technical Associations and Societies. It also suggests them take part in several Technical Events, Competitions, Seminars and Quizzes.

</p><br/>
<p data-aos="zoom-in">Alongside the curricular activities, students are motivated to take part in various co-curricular and extra- curricular activities. The mentors in our Skill Development Centre mold their personalities with Soft Skills Training. The department also provides proper guidance to the students to take up Graduate Aptitude Test for Engineers (GATE) and Graduate Record Examination (GRE) during their final year study. The department aims at 100% employability and campus placement for all eligible candidates. Every year our students secure placements in top companies like TCS, AMAZON, TECH MAHINDRA, MEDHA SERVO etc.
